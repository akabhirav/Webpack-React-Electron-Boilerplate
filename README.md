##Webpack React Electron Boilerplate

###Introduction

A very minimal boilerplate for creating a Desktop application with a react app.

Just combined information from a few sources listed below:

[Building a desktop application with Electron - Kristian Poslek](https://medium.com/developers-writing/building-a-desktop-application-with-electron-204203eeb658)

[Developing desktop applications with Electron and React - M Ahsan](https://medium.com/@Agro/developing-desktop-applications-with-electron-and-react-40d117d97564)

and official documentation of the technologies involved(not much required though)

This boilerplate is well documented and is enough to get you going on the right track to build a desktop application with electron and react.

###Getting Started
Right now you have to run two commands to get this application started.
1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run webpack`. Keep this running. **Do not Close this terminal**
4. run `npm start` in another terminal.

This should open the electron app with react app running inside it.

###Missing Features(For my note)
1. Applications own database for storing data offline(maybe, need to decide whether needed or not)
2. Build app for production

###Issues?
Don't worry just raise an issue in github, and i'll look into it.
